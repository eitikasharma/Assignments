        <h2>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
            
        <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food By Bil Granger. Ever since tasting those eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross.<br>Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted. </p>
            
        <p>
        This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why, it has to be believed.    
        </p>    
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
